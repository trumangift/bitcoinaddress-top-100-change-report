Do you know
what time it is?
Can't sleep.
There are tabs
for that.
Yeah, but then
I'd be sleeping.
Dreams again?
Wanna fight?
I slipped.
Right, you slipped
as a result of me
punching you in the face.
I was already slipping
when you happened
to punch me in the face.
The two events
were not related.
Tell me about this dream.
- Anything new?
- No.
You have to let go
of the past.
I don't remember my past.
It's causing you doubt,
and doubt
makes you vulnerable.
Control it.
Lose control again,
and you'll have to commune
with the
Supreme Intelligence.
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.
Humor is a distraction.
And anger?
Anger only serves
the enemy.
<i>One hundred twenty days</i>
<i>since the last Skrull attack.</i>
<i>Has anyone ever seen</i>
what the Supreme Intelligence
really looks like?
No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence
in its true form.
You know that.
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.
So it's sacred.
It's personal.
No Kree divulges it, ever.
Who do you see?
- Your brother?
- No.
- Father?
- No.
- Your old commander?
- Vers.
It's me you see,
isn't it?
I see
what you're trying to do.
- Is it working?
- Yes.
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.
What is the point
of giving me these...
if you don't want me
to use them?
I want you to use them.
The Supreme Intelligence
gave me a responsibility...
of showing you
how to use them.
I know how.
Yeah, if that were true,
you'd be able to
knock me down without them.
Control your impulses.
Stop using this,
start using this.
I want you to be
the best version of yourself.
Vers.
Intelligence.
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.
I am.
You struggle
with your emotions...
with your past,
which fuels them.
You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion...
that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.
Imposters
who silently infiltrate...
then take over our planets.
Horrors that you remember...
and so much that you do not.
It's all blank.
My life.
You're supposed
to take the form
of who I most admire...
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.
Perhaps this is a mercy
sparing you
from a deeper pain.
Freeing you to do
what all Kree must...
put your people's needs
before your own.
We've given you
a great gift.
The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.
I want to serve.
Then master yourself.
What was given
can be taken away.
I won't let you down.
We'll know soon enough.
You have a mission.
Serve well, and with honor.
This can't be good.
Must be another
Skrull attack.
Whatever it is, it's big.
Has a Skrull
ever simmed you?
Once.
- It was deeply disturbing.
- Why?
Because I stared into the
face of my mortal enemy...
and the face staring back
was my own.
Maybe if you were
more attractive,
then it would be
less disturbing.
You think you're funny,
but I'm not laughing.
You never laugh.
I laugh on the inside.
I'm not doing that now.
It's funny 'cause,
objectively speaking,
you're quite handsome.
Well, thank you.
Listen up, team.
Knock it off.
All right.
Prepare for...
a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.
This time, Torfa.
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.
The signal was intercepted,
and his cover's blown.
The Skrull general, Talos,
has sent kill units
to find him.
Should they reach him
before we do...
the intelligence
he's acquired
over three years
is as good as theirs.
The Accusers will bomb
a Skrull stronghold
here in the south.
We slip in,
we locate Soh-Larr...
and we get out,
leaving them none the wiser.
The Torfan populace.
We are not to interfere
with them,
nor them with us.
Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.
Proceed with caution.
Follow protocol
before extracting him.
This is
a dangerous mission.
We must all be ready
to join the Collective
if that is our fate today.
For the good of all Kree.
For the good
of all Kree!
Vers,
track Soh-Larr's beacon.
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva,
find elevation.
Locals on the periphery.
Maybe a dozen.
Minn-Erva?
Do you read me?
Does anybody copy?
Repeat.
His beacon's coming from
that temple. Let's move.
No. This is a perfect spot
for an ambush.
Only one way in,
only one way out.
We can get past the locals.
We don't know if they are locals.
Too risky.
You don't have to go
with me. I'll go alone.
No, you won't.
Right. We keep a close radius.
We lose comms,
we meet back at the <i>Helion.</i>
Come on.
Att-Lass, you getting this?
Copy. I see them.
Get back!
Commander?
Get back! Back!
Minn-Erva?
Do you have eyes on this?
Keep them back.
Minn-Erva?
Does anybody copy?
I don't wanna hurt you.
Keep back!
Stay back!
They're locals.
I found two dead. No green.
They're just starving.
HGX-78.
TRT79-VVX6.
Get back.
Skrulls!
Vers!
<i>Vers? Skrulls.</i>
<i>It's an ambush.</i>
Incoming!
Back to the <i>Helion.</i>
<i>Vers. Do you copy?</i>
<i>Back to the</i> Helion.
<i>Come in. Vers.</i>
How did you know the code?
How about
I tell you my secret...
when you've told me yours?
<i>Let's open her up.</i>
<i>Where are we?</i>
<i>Stand by.</i>
Where's your head at?
In the clouds.
Where's yours?
On my shoulders.
About to show these boys
how we do it.
You ready?
Higher, further,
faster, baby.
That's right.
<i>This can't be right.</i>
<i>Go back even further.</i>
You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!
<i>Who is this person?
Are we in the right...?</i>
What the hell
are you thinking?
You don't belong out here!
<i>I think
we went back too far.</i>
You let him drive.
<i>Let me try something.</i>
Give up already!
You don't belong out here!
You're not strong enough.
You'll kill yourself.
They'll never let you fly.
<i>Am I the only one
that's confused here?</i>
You're a decent pilot.
But you're too emotional.
You do know why they call it
a cockpit, don't you?
A huge rumble throughout
the cosmos shook the moon...
and the sun and the stars
in the sky.
And so,
little Alouette flew up
throughout the night.
Did you see her?
It's Alouette.
Get your butts inside,
it's time to eat.
Prepare for takeoff,
Lieutenant Trouble.
<i>Charming memory.</i>
<i>Hang on.</i>
<i>I think I've got it.</i>
Goose likes you.
She doesn't typically
take to people.
Early start to your morning.
Uh, late night, actually.
I can't sleep
when there's work to do.
Sound familiar?
Flying your planes
never feels like work.
Wonderful view, isn't it?
I prefer the view
from up there.
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.
<i>Wait! Wait, wait!
That's her. Get her back.</i>
<i>Stand by.</i>
Sound familiar?
Wonderful view, isn't it?
I prefer the view
from up there.
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.
<i>What's that
on her shirt?</i>
<i>I couldn't read it.</i>
Wonderful view, isn't it?
I prefer the view
from up there.
- <i>Focus.</i>
- Excuse me?
<i>Look down.</i>
<i>Focus.</i>
<i>"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson."
That's her.</i>
Do you hear that, too?
<i>Do we have
her location?</i>
<i>Got it.</i>
<i>Now track Lawson until
we find the energy signature.</i>
<i>Interesting.</i>
<i>Huh. Hold on.</i>
<i>Go back right before this.
Go back.</i>
That's no MiG, Lawson.
<i>This is it.
Now let me see where you're headed.</i>
<i>That's right.
Look at the coordinates.</i>
<i>Focus.</i>
<i>Open, please.</i>
<i>That's it. That's it.</i>
<i>You're almost there.</i>
<i>You're almost there.
Don't fight it.</i>
<i>Focus!</i>
<i>Get her back!
Get her back now!</i>
This doesn't make any sense.
Do we have any information
we can act on?
Just that Lawson was
somewhere on planet C-53.
We're on our way.
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.
Lawson is our link
to that light-speed engine!
And everything we're after.
Oh!
That did something.
Try that again.
Not yet!
What did you do to me?
Now we're just after
a little information.
What did you put in my head?
Nothing that wasn't
already there.
But those aren't my memories.
Yeah, it's like a bad trip,
isn't it?
I'm not surprised
you can't keep it straight.
They really did
a number on you.
Enough of your mind games.
What do you want?
We're looking for the location
of a Dr. Lawson...
and her light-speed engine.
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.
Really? Then why is she
in your head?
You guys
wouldn't happen to know
how these things come off,
would ya?
No?
Fine.
Hmm.
Hey.
<i>You do
know why they call it a...</i>
You leaving so soon?
We're just getting to know
each other.
Vers to Starforce command,
do you read me?
Hello? Do you copy?
Hi. I'm Vers.
Kree Starforce.
Is this C-53?
Do you understand me? Is my
universal translator working?
Yeah. I understand you.
Oh, good.
Are you in charge of security
for this district?
Sort of. Uh,
the movie theater has its own guy.
Where can I find
communications equipment?
Thank you.
Track the pod.
Find the girl.
She knows more
than she knows.
Hey.
This one's taken.
Come on.
<i>Vers?</i>
Vers?
Verify. CTC-39.
<i>GRXV-1600.</i>
<i>And I'm fine,
thank you for asking.</i>
<i>Is everyone okay?
What happened?</i>
Skrull ambush.
I thought we'd lost you.
Did you find Soh-Larr?
<i>It wasn't Soh-Larr.</i>
<i>Talos simmed him.
Even knew his code.</i>
That's impossible.
That code was buried
in his unconscious.
The Skrulls
messed with my mind.
The machine that they used...
I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.
Vers, where are you?
<i>I'm on planet C-53.</i>
The Skrulls are looking for
someone named Lawson.
<i>Who?</i>
She's who I see.
<i>She's what?</i>
<i>Vers?</i>
Vers, what?
She's a scientist.
They think that she's cracked
the code on light-speed tech.
I have to get to her
before they do...
<i>or else they'll be able
to invade new galaxies.</i>
No. You've been
caught once already.
How far is C-53?
Closest jump point
is 22 hours.
<i>Vers, hold your
position until we get there.</i>
<i>Keep your comms online
so we can contact you.</i>
No! What if they get
a hold of it before...
<i>We're sorry.</i>
<i>A long-distance
company access code</i>
<i>is required for the number
you have dialed.</i>
- Yon-Rogg?
- Vers?
Vers?
<i>Please dial your call
with the access code.</i>
Vers?
If the Skrulls got
to her, she's compromised.
She's stronger
than you think.
Ever been to C-53?
Once.
It's a real shithole.
Hey, rookie!
Go talk to the rent-a-cop.
Did you call this in?
<i>Beacon activated.</i>
Excuse me, miss.
You know anything
about a lady blowing a hole...
through the roof of that
Blockbuster over there?
Witness says
she was dressed for laser tag.
Oh.
Yeah, I think
she went that way.
Uh, I'd like to ask you
some questions.
Maybe give you the         on the late-night drop box.
Could I see
some identification, please?
Vers. Kree Starforce.
We don't carry
our identification
on little cards.
Vers?
Starforce?
How long you plan
to be in town?
oh, I'll be
out of your hair...
as soon as I track down
the Skrulls
that are infiltrating
your planet.
Skrulls?
Shapeshifters?
They can transform into any
life-form down to the DNA.
Oh, boy. You guys don't have
any clue, do you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.
How do we know you're not
one of those shapeshifters?
Congratulations, Agent Fury.
You have finally asked
a relevant question.
No! Congratulations to you,
Starforce lady.
You're under arrest.
Rook!
Rook, let's roll!
Did you see her weapon?
I did not.
Watch it!
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.
"Trust me,
true believer." "Trust me."
"Trust me, true believer."
Get off!
Train's heading
for a tunnel up ahead.
Let's greet them
at the station.
<i>Mr. Fury,
this is Agent Coulson.</i>
Uh, I'm still here
at the Blockbuster.
And, uh,
where'd everybody go?
<i>I finished
collecting evidence...</i>
We need an ambulance!
Someone call 911!
Hey! You all right?
Oh, my gosh!
Is everyone okay?
Anyone else see that?
Official S.H.I.E.L.D.
activity. Stay back.
Nice scuba suit.
Lighten up, honey, huh?
Got a smile for me?
Freak.
All life on Earth
is carbon-based. Not this guy.
Whatever he runs on,
it's not
on the periodic table.
You're saying
he's not from around here?
Hey, how's your eye?
Well, I'd say fine...
but it can't believe
what it's seeing.
You say this thing
looked like Coulson?
Mmm. Talked like him, too.
And the woman said
that there were more?
The word she used
was "infiltration."
You believe her?
Not till I saw this.
What's your plan?
I'll find Blockbuster girl.
I got word
on a motorcycle thief
that fits her description.
If she can tell us
why these lizards are here...
maybe she can tell us
how to kick 'em to the curb.
Good.
Do it alone, though.
We can't trust anyone.
Not even our own men.
Yes, sir.
Wow. They're ugly bastards,
aren't they?
Yeah,
well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.
Safe journey to the beyond,
my friend.
I will finish
what we started.
I wouldn't get
too close there, boss.
No one in or out.
Boom!
What can I get ya?
Where was
this photograph taken?
An airport.
Where's Pegasus?
That's classified.
Not unlike the file
I started on you.
But I see you've changed
it up a bit since then.
Grunge is a good look
for you.
Did you have a rough day,
Agent Fury?
It was cool, you know?
Had a space invasion,
big car chase.
Got to watch
an alien autopsy.
Typical nine-to-five.
So you saw one?
I was never one
to believe in aliens...
but I can't unsee that.
This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I gotta ask.
You think I'm one of
those green things.
Can't be too careful.
You are looking at
100% red-blooded Earth man.
I'm afraid
I'm gonna need proof.
We talking cheek swab
or urine sample?
No. The DNA would match.
Want my AOL password?
Skrulls can only sim
recent memories
- of their host bodies.
- Oh, oh.
You wanna get personal.
- Where were you born?
- Huntsville, Alabama.
But technically,
I don't remember that part.
- Name of your first pet?
- Mr. Snoofers.
- Mr. Snoofers?
- That's what I said.
Do I pass?
Not yet. First job?
Soldier. Straight out of
high school.
Left the ranks
a full bird colonel.
- Then?
- Spy.
- Where?
- It was the Cold War.
We were everywhere.
Uh, Belfast. Bucharest.
Belgrade. Budapest.
I like the B's.
I can make them rhyme.
- Now?
- Been riding a desk
for the past six years...
trying to figure out
where our
future enemies
are coming from.
Never occurred to me
they would be coming
from above.
Name a detail so bizarre
a Skrull could never
fabricate it.
If toast is cut diagonally,
I can't eat it.
You didn't need that,
did you?
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.
Okay. Your turn.
Prove you're not a Skrull.
And how is that
supposed to prove to me
you're not a Skrull?
That's a photon blast.
And?
A Skrull can't do that.
So, a full bird colonel
turned spy
turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...
must have pretty high
security clearance.
Where's Pegasus?
Okay.
The Skrulls sim alien races
to infiltrate
and take over planets.
And you're a Kree?
A race of noble warriors?
Heroes.
Noble warrior heroes.
So, um, what do Skrulls
want with Dr. Lawson?
They believe
that she developed
a light-speed engine
at Pegasus.
Light-speed engine?
Gotta admit, that's not
the craziest thing
I've heard today.
Well, it's still early.
And you,
what do you want?
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.
And?
Look, war is
a universal language.
I know a rogue soldier
when I see one.
You got a personal stake
in this.
<i>This is government property.</i>
<i>Turn your vehicle around.</i>
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
<i>Place your thumb on the pad.</i>
<i>One moment.</i>
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
You have three names?
Everybody calls me Fury.
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph.
Not Nick. Just Fury.
- What does your mom call you?
- Fury.
- What do you call her?
- Fury.
What about your kids?
If I have them,
they'll call me Fury.
<i>You are cleared
for access.</i>
Thank you.
Oh, hold up.
You look like somebody's
disaffected niece.
Put that on.
- What is it?
- It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.
Does, uh, announcing
your identity on clothing
help with the covert part
of your job?
Said the space soldier who
was wearing a rubber suit.
Lose the flannel.
How can I help you?
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
We're looking for a woman
named Lawson.
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.
Do you know her?
Follow me.
Hmm.
You familiar with the phrase
"welcome wagon"?
No.
Well, this ain't it.
Is that a communicator?
Yeah. State-of-the-art
two-way pager.
Who are you paging?
My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.
After you.
Impressive.
Oh, you should see what I
can do with a paperclip.
Hey, there. How are you?
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
Just look at you.
Aren't you
the cutest little thing?
Aren't you cute?
And what's your name, huh?
What's your name?
"Goose."
Cool name for a cool cat.
Fury?
Hmm?
I'll be back.
Oh! Let me get
my fingerprint out.
Just let me unravel
this puppy.
You sat there and watched me
play with tape?
When all you had to do was...
I didn't wanna steal
your thunder.
Huh. Lawson.
Lawson's plan
for the light-speed engine.
I wonder why
they terminated the project.
Um, maybe because
she's cuckoo.
Kree glyphs?
Hmm?
Lawson is not cuckoo.
She's Kree.
Well, she's dead.
What?
She crashed
the Asis aircraft
doing an unauthorized
test flight.
Took a pilot down
with her.
That's why security here
is so unfriendly.
They're covering up
a billion-dollar mistake.
Oh, and your light-speed
engine is toast.
When did this crash happen?
Six years ago. 1989.
Who was the pilot?
Um, most of
this thing's redacted...
but there is a testimonial
here from a Maria Rambeau.
Last person
to see them alive.
You okay?
Mm-hmm.
Back in a minute.
This isn't about
fighting wars.
It's about ending them.
<i>I know Lawson was Kree.</i>
She was here on C-        and died in a plane crash.
<i>Do you know anything
about this?</i>
I just discovered
a mission report
sent from C-53.
There's only so much
I'm cleared to tell you,
Vers, but...
<i>Lawson was an undercover
Kree operative named Mar-Vell.</i>
She was working
on a unique energy core.
Experimenting with tech
that apparently could
help us win the war.
She still here?
She's cooperating
with the investigation, sir.
- You men stay here.
- Yes, sir.
I want to
question her alone.
Excellent work, Nicholas.
Does it say anything
about me?
Anything about you?
No, of course not.
<i>Why would it?</i>
I found evidence
that I had a life here.
<i>On C-53?</i>
Mar-Vell is who I see
when I visit
the Supreme Intelligence.
I knew her.
And I knew her as Lawson.
This sounds like
Skrull simulation, Vers.
No, it's not. Because I remember.
I was here.
<i>Stop. Remember your training.</i>
Know your enemy.
It could be you.
<i>Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.</i>
She's on sublevel six.
I'll get off on five...
and take the stairs in case
she makes a run for it.
Do a pincer move
like we did in Havana.
Right. Like we did
in Havana.
<i>We're nearing
the jump point.</i>
<i>Leave your beacon on
so I can find you.</i>
We'll get to
the bottom of this, Vers.
Together.
Okay.
Vers!
Vers!
Fury's colluding
with the target.
Then why would he call us in?
All I know is
we take him in, too.
Dead or alive.
Dead or alive?
Go. Go, go!
Was it something I said?
Mmm-mmm.
Now, you know, I don't really
need these to see...
but they do
kinda complete the look.
Don't you think?
You called them in?
My bad.
Coulson,
do you have eyes on them?
They're not down here.
Let's try up there.
- What?
- Your communicator.
You obviously
can't be trusted with it.
Do you know
how to fly this thing?
Uh, we'll see.
That's a yes or no question.
Yes.
That's what I'm talking about!
We got a stowaway.
Hang on, Goose.
Goose.
No, Goose.
Who's a good kitty, huh?
Huh, Goose?
Yes, that's right.
Who's a good kitty, Goose?
You the good kitty,
that's right.
See anyone you know?
Funny story.
I arrived on Hala near dead.
No memory.
That was six years ago.
So, you think
you're the pilot
that went down
with Dr. Lawson?
I'm saying the last person
to see them alive
could probably tell us.
- Maria Rambeau?
- Mm-hmm.
So, how do we get
to Louisiana?
Due east.
Hang a right at Memphis.
That agent...
that stopped the Skrulls
from finding us?
Coulson. The new guy.
I guess
he doesn't hate me yet.
Yeah, well, give him time.
I guess he had a feeling,
you know?
Went with his gut
against orders.
That's a really
hard thing to do.
But it's what
keeps us human.
I get in trouble for that.
A lot.
Oh, I can see that about you.
Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls?
I'm guessing that's not
standard
Kree operating procedure.
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.
Ronan.
<i>The Accusers completed
their operation...</i>
<i>but the greater mission
was a failure,</i>
<i>thanks to your team.</i>
It was a trap
to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.
<i>Give us their location.</i>
<i>We'll take care
of the terrorist threat.</i>
By bombing them
out of the galaxy?
No, we'll handle this.
<i>A cell of Skrulls anywhere</i>
<i>is a threat
to Kree everywhere.</i>
<i>Where are they?</i>
- They are...
- Lost.
They are lost for now.
But we will find them.
<i>Do so, or we will.</i>
Maintain the course
for C-53.
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.
Auntie Carol?
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!
I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!
But we knew they were lying.
I'm not really
who you think I am.
That is the craziest shit
I ever heard.
Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.
You are
absolutely right, young lady.
There is no such thing.
'Cause if there were,
we would want to keep that
to ourselves.
You don't believe me?
No way!
That's so cool!
Oh, she can do
a lot more than make tea
with those hands.
Like what? Show us.
Maybe later.
I kept all your stuff.
I'll go get it.
You want to give her
a hand with that?
Hmm?
You don't remember anything?
I see flashes.
Little moments.
But I can't tell
what's real.
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...
maybe it'll all
make sense.
You woke me up
banging on my door at dawn.
Your usual move.
Back then,
we had to get up so early.
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot
at doing something
that mattered.
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...
and I wasn't about to argue,
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.
But you cheated,
took a shortcut.
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?
Since it violates
the predetermined
rules of engagement.
I definitely
don't remember those.
Hmm. Of course you don't.
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.
She said
she had lives to save.
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,
but you said that...
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.
Yeah. Yep.
Big hero moment.
01:
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.
01:
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.
01:
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.
01:
I know this must be
hard for you.
01:
Oh, what?
This part right here?
01:
No. No. Mmm-mmm.
01:
Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...
01:
in a mission so secret
01:
they act like it never
even happened.
01:
Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere
01:
too damn stubborn to die.
01:
And now you come up in here
after six years...
01:
with your supercharged
fire hands...
01:
and you expect me
to call you...
01:
I don't even know what.
Vers?
01:
Is that really
who you are now?
01:
I don't know.
        Come look!
        This is me and you
on Halloween.
        I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.
        Oh, this is you
when you were little.
        You didn't get along
with your parents...
        so Mom said
we became your real family.
        This is us on Christmas.
        I got my favorite
bunny slippers.
        This is another picture of you
when you were little.
        You've always wanted
to be a pilot.
        And this is right after
you graduated.
        This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...
        This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.
        And this is you with Mom
        right after a good day
of training.
        These were
your three favorite guys.
        Oh, wait. I forgot.
        Your jacket.
        Mom doesn't
let me wear it anymore
        after I spilled
ketchup on it.
        That was all
that survived the crash.
        Or so we thought.
        Don't answer that.
        It's just my neighbor.
        They can change into anyone.
        Hi there.
        What do you want?
        - Uh...
- Hey, Tom.
        This is my friend, Carol.
        Oh. Pleased to meet you.
        Yowzers.
        Static electricity
out here's no joke.
        I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...
        and I was just wondering...
        if you mind
if I bring the boys over
        to get a closer look-see?
        - A closer look-see?
- Yeah.
        To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?
        Mmm.
        You're really working
overtime
        to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?
        I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.
        I'll come by tomorrow, okay?
        - Uh...
- Okay.
        You know, you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.
        You never know
when you're gonna need
        to borrow some sugar.
        Now, hang on a second.
        Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...
        making a mess
of your friend's house...
        It's a lovely home, miss.
        Oh, my God!
        What the hell?
        No one's gonna hurt the girl.
        Just don't kill me.
        That would really complicate
the situation.
        I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall
        with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.
        I'm sorry
I simmed your boss.
        But now I stand before you
as my true self.
        Without deception.
        And who is that out there?
        Okay, that's a fair point...
        but I'm sure
that you understand
        I had to take
some precautions.
        I saw you crush
20 of my best men
        with your hands bound.
        I just wanna talk.
        Last time we talked,
        I ended up
hanging from my ankles.
        That was before I knew
who you were.
        Before I knew what made you
different from the others.
        I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...
        of your voice
from a plane crash
        six years ago...
        on a device I believe
you call a "black box."
        They told me it was
destroyed in the crash.
        How'd you get it?
        She don't understand.
        Young lady,
I have a special skill...
        that kind of allows me
        to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.
        Call me
"young lady" again...
        I'm gonna put my foot
in a place
        it's not supposed to be.
        Am I supposed to guess
where that is?
        Your ass.
        Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.
        But, look,
I just need your help
        decoding some coordinates.
        If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...
        I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.
        Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.
        Deal.
        Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.
        How'd that get in here?
        Hmm?
        The cat?
        This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?
        That's not a cat.
        - That's a Flerken.
- A Flerken?
        Mom?
        Monica.
        - Why can't I listen, too?
- Shh!
        What's happening?
        It's loading.
        <i>Punch in the coordinates</i>
        <i>5-2-2-9,
negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.</i>
        <i>Copy that.
Where are we going, Doc?</i>
        <i>My laboratory.</i>
        <i>Your laboratory?
What do you mean?</i>
        <i>Oh, no.</i>
        <i>Is that...
Wait, what is that?</i>
        <i>It's not showing up
on my radar.</i>
        <i>Go, Carol. Fly!</i>
        That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?
        Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!
        Yes, ma'am.
        - What do they want?
- Me. My work.
        I never should have
brought you along.
        Here come some G's.
        They're firing backwards.
Hold on!
        Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!
        Stay with me, Lawson!
        <i>Carol, come in. Do you copy?</i>
        Yeah, I copy.
We hit ground.
        <i>Carol, are you okay?
Do you copy?</i>
        Yeah! I copy.
        Doc?
        Your blood.
        It's blue.
        Yeah, but, uh,
how's my hair?
        Help me out, will ya?
        I gotta destroy it
before they get here.
        Lawson?
        You remember what I said about
our work here?
        What it's for?
        To end wars?
        Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.
        Damn it!
        My name is not Lawson.
        My real name is Mar-Vell,
        and I come
from a planet called Hala.
        I would say
that you're delusional...
        but we just got shot down
by a spaceship
        and your blood is blue.
        Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.
        Now, skedaddle
before you give me
        any more regrets.
        Just remember
the coordinates, okay?
        You gotta save 'em without me.
        Save who? How?
        Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.
        What are you doing?
        We have no interest
in hurting you.
        No?
        'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!
        The energy core.
        Where is it?
        Pararescue's on the way.
        You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.
        Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.
        No, wait!
        You mean that energy core?
        No!
        Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.
        Hold your fire.
        There's nothing left.
        The core has been destroyed.
        She absorbed its power.
        She's coming with us.
        He lied to me.
        Everything that I knew
was a lie.
        Now, you understand.
        What?
What do I understand now?
        Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.
        He killed her...
        'cause she found out
that she was
        on the wrong side
of an unjust war.
        No.
        Your people are terrorists.
        They kill innocents.
        I saw the ruins on Torfa.
        Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.
        My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.
        Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...
        and they destroyed
our planet.
        And the handful of us
that are left
        will be slaughtered next...
        unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.
        The core that she found
        would have powered
a light-speed ship...
        capable of carrying us
to safety.
        A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.
        Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus
        wasn't to fight wars...
        but to end them.
        She wanted you to help us
find the core.
        Well, I already destroyed it.
        No, you destroyed
the engine.
        The core that powered it
is in a remote location.
        If you help us
decode those coordinates...
        we can find it.
        You'll use it
to destroy us.
        We just want a home.
        You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.
        Can't you see it now?
        You're not one of them.
        You don't know me.
        You have no idea
who I am.
        I don't even know
who I am!
        You are Carol Danvers.
        You are the woman
on that black box
        risking her life
to do the right thing.
        My best friend...
        who supported me
as a mother and a pilot
        when no one else did.
        You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...
        and you were the most
powerful person I knew...
        way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.
        You hear me?
        Do you hear me?
        Come here. Come here, girl.
        I got you.
        <i>I know
I don't deserve your trust...</i>
        but you were our only lead.
        We discovered
that your energy signature
        matched Mar-Vell's core.
        Now we know why.
        If only you knew
the importance of it to me.
        I just need your help
        decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.
        Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.
        For orbital position
and velocity.
        You didn't find her lab
on Earth,
        'cause it's not on Earth.
        That was the location
        on the date
of the crash six years ago.
        If we track its course,
        we'll find it in orbit
right now.
        It's just basic physics.
        In orbit?
        Was that so difficult
to figure out?
        I mean, you're
my science guy, right?
        Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.
        We've got to get to the core
before he does.
        Mmm. We're going
to space?
        In what?
        A few tweaks
to your vessel should do it.
        I can handle
the modifications.
        Mmm. Your science guy.
        Well, I could use
a copilot.
        No. No, I can't.
        I can't leave Monica.
        Mom, it's okay. I can stay
with Gramma and Paw-paw.
        There's no way I'm going,
baby. It's too dangerous.
        Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous...
        and you used to do that.
        Your plan
is to leave the atmosphere
        in a craft not designed
for the journey...
        and you anticipate
hostile encounters...
        with
a technologically-superior
        foreign enemy.
        Correct?
        That's what I'm saying.
        - You have to go!
- Monica!
        You have a chance
to fly the coolest mission
        in the history
of missions...
        and you're gonna give it up
to sit on the couch
        and watch <i>Fresh Prince</i>
with me?
        What?
        I just think
you should consider...
        what kind of example you're
setting for your daughter.
        What's going on around here?
        I know, I know.
        I'll explain inside.
Thank you.
        Your mom's lucky.
        When they were
handing out kids,
        they gave her
the toughest one.
        Lieutenant Trouble.
        You remembered.
        Is that mine?
        No, no.
        You hang on to it
until I come back.
        But there is something
that I need your help with.
        I can't wear
these Kree colors anymore.
        And since you are obviously
the only person around here
        with any sense of style...
        Hmm?
        Whoa.
        No.
        Uh-uh.
        Definitely not.
        Well, since we're
on the same team...
        Hmm.
        How do I look?
        Fresh.
        What took you so long?
        I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.
        - PRY46-B...
- No, no codes.
        That system is fallible,
as we've learned.
        Okay, then let's do this.
        Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?
        The person you most admire
and respect, I'd guess.
        But you would never
tell me who.
        And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?
        The transfusion.
        Blue blood
running through my veins.
        Whose blood?
        Hmm.
        That's my blood that's
coursing through her veins.
        What have you done with her?
        You're too late.
        She knows?
        Ronan, Skrulls have
infiltrated C-53.
        Come at once.
        <i>For the good of all Kree,
Commander...</i>
        <i>the infestation
will be eradicated.</i>
        Passing 500 and climbing.
        You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.
        Our little alliance with you
is tenuous at best.
        And as long as he continues
to freak you out...
        like that...
        yeah, I'm gonna keep
giving him
        all the loves and hugs
that he needs, right?
        Can I ask you something?
        Do you just turn into
anything you want?
        Ah, well,
I have to see it first.
        Can you all do it?
        Physiologically? Yeah.
        But, uh, it takes practice...
        and, um, dare I say it,
talent to do it well.
        - Can you turn into a cat?
- What's a cat?
        What about a filing cabinet?
        Why would I turn into
a filing cabinet?
        A Venus flytrap?
        I'll give you
50 bucks right now
        if you turn into
a Venus flytrap.
        Switching engines
        from Scramjet to Fusion.
Buckle up, folks.
        Hey.
        Is this normal,
like, space turbulence?
        Pretty much.
        Locking in
on coordinate grid.
        Where is it?
        It's here.
It's gotta be here.
        Well, is it in front of all
that nothing, or behind it?
        <i>Decloaking activated.</i>
        Is that it? The core?
        In her notes she called it
the Tesseract.
        Whoa.
        What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?
        We're not alone.
        Talos!
        He didn't come here
for the Tesseract.
        It's okay.
        We didn't know what to do.
        Mar-Vell warned us not to send
a signal for any reason...
        or the Kree would find us.
        You did the right thing.
        It's okay, it's okay.
        She's all right.
She's a friend.
        I am not gonna hurt you.
        She led me to you.
        I'm so sorry.
        I didn't know.
        Carol.
        This is war.
        My hands are
filthy from it, too.
        But we're here now.
        You found my family.
        This is just the beginning.
        There are thousands of us
separated from each other...
        scattered throughout
the galaxy.
        If I played the same pinball
machine for six years...
        I'd have
some high scores, too.
        Fraternizing with the enemy?
        Uh-uh.
        What did you do
to your uniform?
        They got in her head.
Just like we thought.
        The Supreme Intelligence
will set her straight.
        You can see
they're not soldiers.
        Let 'em go.
You can have me.
        And the core?
        You lied to me.
        I made you
the best version of yourself.
        What's given
can be taken away.
        Back here! Move, move!
        Get over here. Get down!
        Let's go! Go, move!
        There she is.
        Seems like your time on C-        jogged the old memory.
        This jacket.
        It's killer,
by the way.
        Oh.
        The music.
It's a nice touch.
        Let me out.
        No can do.
        If you hurt them,
I will burn you to the ground.
        With what exactly?
        Your power comes from us.
        You didn't give me
these powers.
        The blast did.
        And yet, you've never had
the strength
        to control them
on your own.
        <i>Species: Flerken.</i>
        <i>Threat: high.</i>
        It's a cat,
not Hannibal Lecter.
        <i>Species: human male.</i>
        <i>Threat: low to none.</i>
        That thing's
clearly busted.
        Load the Flerken
onto the <i>Helion.</i>
        Eject the others into space.
        You did good, Ace.
        Thanks to you...
        those insidious shapeshifters
        will threaten
our borders no more.
        I used to believe
your lies...
        but the Skrulls are
just fighting for a home.
        You're talking
about destroying them
        because they won't submit
to your rule.
        And neither will I.
        We found you.
We embraced you as our own.
        You stole me.
        From my home,
my family, my friends.
        It's cute how hard you try.
        But remember...
        without us...
        <i>Give it up, Carol.</i>
        <i>Stay down!</i>
        ...you're weak.
        <i>You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!</i>
        You're flawed.
        <i>Are you trying
to kill yourself?</i>
        Helpless.
        <i>You're too emotional
and so weak.</i>
        <i>You don't belong out here!</i>
        We saved you.
        - <i>Control it.</i>
- <i>I told you,</i>
        - <i>Carol.</i>
- <i>They'll never</i>
        - <i>let you fly.</i>
- <i>This ain't</i>
        - <i>a game for little girls.</i>
- <i>You kiss like a horse.</i>
        <i>You won't last
a week, Danvers.</i>
        Without us,
you're only human.
        You're right.
        I'm only human.
        On Hala,
you were reborn...
        Vers.
        My name is Carol.
        She's trying to break out.
        I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.
        But what happens when...
        I'm finally set free?
        You know you're glowing,
right?
        I'll explain it later.
        Take the Tesseract.
        Leave the lunchbox.
        - Me?
- Yes.
        I'm not touching that thing.
        You want me to
get you an oven mitt?
        Whoa!
        Get the Skrulls
on the Quadjet and go.
        Take the Flerken with you.
        - What about you?
- I'll buy you some time!
        I'm picking you up now.
        I'm trusting you
not to eat me.
        Oh, hey, guys.
        Arm wrestle
for the Tesseract?
        I used to find you amusing.
        Let's put an end to this.
        Okay.
        Good kitty.
        You knew all along.
        Is that why
we never hung out?
        No, I just never
liked you.
        Incoming!
        Hey, in a hurry?
        Don't make me do this.
        Okay.
        Come on, do your thing!
        Come on!
        Come on!
        Damn it, Goose.
        Pick a side.
        Take them
to the hangar, too.
        We'll blast them all
into space.
        Play it cool.
        Just like Havana.
        Do you have the thing?
        Flerken kitty ate it.
        Come on, move!
        Move!
        Follow my lead.
        Cover her eyes.
        Onto the ship!
        Let's go! Let's go!
        Nice diversion.
        I could have swore
I put it in there.
        Minn-Erva, take them down
in the drop ship.
        On it.
        You all right, friend?
        Never better.
        We got a bogey coming in hot.
        Yes! Boom!
        Whoo!
        What the hell was that?
        Deploy ballistic warheads.
        That's impossible.
        C-53 doesn't have
a defense system
        advanced enough
to destroy our warheads.
        That's not
their defense system, Ronan.
        Take her down.
        Whoo!
        Return to the jump point.
        We'll be back
for the weapon.
        The core?
        The woman.
        I'm so proud of you.
        You've come a long way
        since I found you
that day by the lake.
        But can you keep
your emotions in check
        long enough to take me on?
        Or will they get the
better of you as always?
        I always told you...
        you'll be ready
        the day you can knock
me down as yourself.
        This is that moment.
        This is that moment, Vers!
        Turn off the light show...
        and prove to me
you can beat me without...
        I have nothing
to prove to you.
        <i>Destination: Hala.</i>
        I can't go back empty-handed.
        You won't be empty-handed.
        I'm sending you
with a message.
        Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.
        The war. The lies.
All of it.
        You can't do this.
        That was a close call,
huh, Goosey? Huh?
        Those bad guys
still in there somewhere?
        Ow!
        Mother Flerken!
        - You okay?
- Yeah.
        It's just a scratch.
        No.
        I can't believe
        you got in the raddest
dogfight ever...
        and I missed it.
        I'd say you arrived
just in time.
        Some nifty flying
you did out there.
        S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use
a good pilot like you.
        I'll consider it...
        as long as you never
call my flying "nifty" again.
        How's your eye?
        Hmm. Getting better
every second.
        Just so I'm clear...
        you were Soh-Larr...
        - and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
- Keller.
        He tied my boss up,
stole his identity.
        I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.
        It is a little like stealing.
        Whose side are you on here?
        You're good to go here
until you recover...
        but you and your family
are gonna need a new look.
        I could go back
to being your boss.
        Uh, please don't.
        Come on. I loved sporting
his beautiful blue eyes.
        No way.
You guys have the best eyes.
        Don't ever change
your eyes.
        She has beautiful eyes.
That's very sweet of you.
        I was trying
not to panic...
        I'll help you find a home.
        Finish what Mar-Vell started.
        They can stay here
with us.
        Can't they, Mom?
        They won't
be safe here, baby.
        Auntie Carol's right.
        They need their own home.
        I'll be back
before you know it.
        Or maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?
        Ah, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.
        Or maybe I'll build
a spaceship.
        - You don't know.
- He doesn't.
        Keep the Tesseract
on Earth.
        Hidden.
        You sure that's what
Marvel would want?
        Mar-Vell.
        That's what I said.
        It's two words. Mar. Vell.
        Mar-Vell.
        "Marvel" sounds a lot better.
        You know,
like the Marvelettes.
        Not ringing any bells?
        Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.
        I upgraded it.
        Range should be a couple
galaxies, at least.
        What? You think
I'm gonna crank call you?
        For emergencies only, okay?
        Well...
        if you're ever passing
back through this galaxy...
        be sure to give
a brother a shout.
        Oh!
        We got
the ketchup stain off.
        Thanks,
Lieutenant Trouble.
        Hmm.
        It's hard for me
to say goodbye, too.
        Go on.
        Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.
        So, is it true?
        That the Kree
burned your eye out...
        because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?
        I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.
        Understood.
        I'm sorry to report
        that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.
        I'm sure it'll turn up
somewhere.
        I'll let you know
when it does.
        Then what?
        Sir?
        We have no idea
        what other intergalactic
threats are out there.
        And our one-woman
security force
        had a prior commitment...
        on the other side
of the universe.
        S.H.I.E.L.D. alone
can't protect us.
        We need to find more.
        More weapons?
        More heroes.
        You think you can find
others like her?
        Hmm, we found her,
and we weren't even looking.
        Get some rest, sir.
        You got
a big decision to make.
        This is a nightmare.
        I've had better nightmares.
        Hey.
        So, that thing just stopped
        doing whatever the hell
it was doing.
        What do we got?
        Whatever signal it was
sending finally crapped out.
        I thought
we bypassed the battery.
        We did.
        It's still plugged in.
It just stopped.
        Reboot it.
Send the signal again.
        We don't even know
what this is.
        Fury did.
Just do it, please.
        You tell me
the second you get a signal.
        I wanna know who's on
the other end of that thing.
        Where's Fury?

你知道现在几点吗？
我睡不着
睡不着吃安眠药
对 可是吃了药就会犯困
你又做梦了
想打一场吗？
我滑倒了
是的 你之所以滑倒
是因为我一拳正打在你脸上
我本来就踩空了
你的拳头
正好碰到我的脸而已
要不讲讲你的梦
有新内容吗？ 没有
你必须要忘记过去
我不记得自己的过去
过去让你迟疑
而迟疑让你脆弱
控制力量
如若再失控
至高智慧就要找你谈话了
对战士来说 情绪波动是最危险的
幽默 只会让你分心
而愤怒
愤怒只会对敌人有利
距斯科鲁人上次袭击
已经120天了
有人见过至高智慧
真正的样子吗？
没人能看到
它的真实面貌
你是知道的
我们的潜意识会选择自己看到的形象
这个形象是神圣的 也是私密的
从来没有克里人透露这个秘密
你看到的是谁
你哥哥 不是
你父亲 不是
你的指挥官 不是
你看到的是我 对吗
我知道你想惹我生气
那你生气了吗 是的
不过转移话题是没用的
要是你不想让我使用这种力量
那把它给我又有什么意义呢
我想让你用
至高智慧分派给我的任务就是
教会你使用力量的方法
我知道怎么用
是 那你不用这种能力
也应该能打败我
控制你冲动的情绪
别总依赖这个 多用用脑子
我希望你能成为最优秀的自己
弗斯
至高智慧
你的上级指挥官说你可以执行任务了
是的
你在挣扎 想控制情绪
想要忘记你痛苦的过去
几百年来 斯库鲁人疯狂扩张
威胁着我们克里文明 你只是受害者之一
他们利用伪装 渗透进其他文明
最终攻占整个行星
你只记得过去的恐惧
却忘记了其他
我的人生是一片空白
你的形象
应该是我最爱戴的人
可是 我甚至想不起来...你化身的这个人到底是谁
或许这样也好
让你免受更深重的痛苦
让你没有负担 成为纯粹的克里人
将克里人民的需求置于自身之上
我们赋予了你强大的力量
你可以为所有克里人的未来而战
我渴望战斗
那就好好控制你自己
我们赋予你的 我们也能收回来
我不会让你失望的
我们很快就会见分晓了
你有新任务了
一定要光荣而出色地完成
这回绝对没有好事
肯定又是斯库鲁人袭击
而且规模不会小
斯库鲁人变成过你吗
就一次
让我深感不安 为什么
因为我看到面前穷凶极恶的敌人的脸
正是自己的脸
你要是长得帅气一点
也许内心就不会这么不安了
你自以为幽默 可我觉得并不好笑
你从来就没笑过
我笑过 是在心里笑
我现在心里没笑
说来好笑 客观来讲
你其实还是挺帅的
多谢夸奖
大家听好 别再闹了
好的
任务是
救出克里人谍报人员 索拉尔
斯库鲁人又入侵了一颗边境行星
这次是托法星
索拉尔发来了警告
但信号被中途截断 他暴露了身份
斯库鲁指挥官 塔罗斯
已经派人去找他
如果他们先找到索拉尔
那他多年来搜集的情报
就会落到敌人手里
指控者舰队
会轰炸南边的要塞掩护我们
我们潜入托法星 找到索拉尔
然后撤退 神不知鬼不觉
至于托法星居民
我们别去惹他们
也别让他们碍事
无论如何都要优先保证完成任务
大家行事要谨慎
带走索拉尔之前要检查代码
这次任务很危险
如若天命已定
那我们都要做好牺牲的准备
为克里人而战！
为克里人而战！
弗斯 追踪索拉尔的信号
阿特莱斯 米涅瓦 找到制高点
外围有托法星人
可能有十几个
米涅瓦?
能听到我说话吗吗？有人能听到吗？
重复一遍
信号是从神庙传来的 我们过去
不行 这儿是绝佳的伏击点
一夫当关 万夫莫开
可以从居民那边绕过去
那些人不一定是真的土著居民 太冒险了
你们留在这里 我一个人过去
不行 你不能去
好吧 大家不要太分散
如果失联 就回氦核飞船碰头
走吧
阿特莱斯 看到了吗
收到 看到他们了
退后
指挥官？
都退后 退后
米涅瓦 你能看到这些人吗
拦住他们 米涅瓦？
有人能听到吗
我不想伤害你们
给我退后
退后
他们是土著居民 我发现两具尸体 没有斯库鲁人
他们只是没吃的
HGX-78.
TRT79-VVX6.
给我退后
是斯库鲁人
弗斯
斯库鲁人
有埋伏
敌人来袭
赶紧回飞船
弗斯 能收到吗
马上回飞船
快回答 弗斯
你怎么会知道接头代码
既然你想知道我的秘密
那就先坦白自己的秘密
打开他的记忆
这是哪里
准备记录
你想什么呢
冲上云霄 你呢
想正事
试飞不能输给那帮男的
准备好了吗
更高 更强 更快 对吧
没错
这段回忆不对
往过去多调一点
你速度太快了 开慢点儿
这个女孩是谁？我们是不是弄错了？
你抽什么疯呢？
你不能来赛车场
我们回调得太多了
你只让他开赛车
让我来试试
已经怂了！
你不能来赛车场
你的力量还不够
这样你会送命的
他们绝不会让你开战机的
难道你们不觉得看不懂吗
你是个好飞行员
但太过情绪化了
驾驶舱不是女人呆的地方 懂吗
只听见轰隆一声巨响 横贯宇宙
宇宙里的太阳 月亮和星星全都吓了一跳
于是
小云雀拍拍翅膀 飞过夜空
你看到她了吗？ 是小云雀
快点下来吧 饭做好了
准备起飞咯 淘气少尉
真是温馨的回忆
等等
我想我找到了
咕咕喵很喜欢你
它一般不和人亲近
今天怎么起这么早
呃 我其实熬夜了
有工作的时候我总是睡不着
你不也一样！
试飞你的飞机是一种享受
景色很美 是不是
我更喜欢空中的景色
你很快就能试飞了 王牌飞行员！
等一下 等等 就是她 倒回去
马上好
你不也一样！
景色很美 是不是
我更喜欢空中的景色
你很快就能试飞了 王牌飞行员！
她外套上戴的是什么？
我看不清
景色很美 是不是
我更喜欢空中的景色
集中精神 什么？
往下看
集中精神
"天马计划  温迪·劳森博士"  就是她
你也听到了吗
定位到她了吗
有了
追踪劳森 直到找到能量信号
真有意思
嗯 等等
往回倒一点 倒退
那可不是米格战机  劳森
就是这儿 让我看看你要去哪
没错  看看坐标
集中精神
睁开眼睛
很好 非常好
马上就看见了
马上好 别抵抗
集中精神
快往后倒 快点
到底怎么回事
我们现在到底有没有拿到对行动有利的信息
只知道劳森博士还在C53行星上
我们这就赶过去
那就挖 深挖 挖到底
找到劳森 就能找到光速引擎
和我们想要的一切
哦！
好像有反应
再来一下
先别开枪
你对我做了什么
我们只是想要点情报
你在我脑子里放了什么
只是读取了你的记忆
可那些不是我的记忆
是啊 像是可怕的幻觉 对吧？
怪不得你思维混乱
那些人对你动了不少手脚
别再耍花招了
你到底想要什么？
我们想从你的记忆里找到劳森博士
和她的光速引擎
我不认识什么劳森博士
真的吗？ 那为什么她会出现在你的记忆里
你们知道
怎么把这东西摘下来吗
不知道？
好吧
嘿
驾驶舱不是女人呆...
这么快就要走了吗
我们才刚刚认识
弗斯呼叫星际战队指挥部 能收到吗？
喂 能听见吗
你好 我叫弗斯 克里星际战队的
这里是C-53行星吗
能听懂吗？ 我的宇宙翻译器应该没坏吧
是的 我听得懂
哦 那就好
你负责这一带的安保工作吗？
算是吧 电影院那边自己雇保安
这里哪儿有通讯设备？
谢谢
追踪逃生舱  找到那个姑娘
她还没意识到其实她所知甚多
嘿
这个我已经选用了
拜托
弗斯？
弗斯？
确认代码 CTC-39.
GRXV-1600.
我很好 谢谢关心
大家还好吗？出什么事了？
斯库鲁人偷袭了我们
我以为你牺牲了
你找到索拉尔了吗？
那根本不是索拉儿
是塔罗斯变的 他还掌握了代码
这...这不可能
代码是埋在潜意识里的
斯库鲁人用机器读取了我的记忆
他们应该也是这样提取了索拉尔的代码
弗斯 你在哪儿？
我在C-53行星上
斯库鲁人正在找一个叫劳森的人
谁？
她就是...我见到的那个人
是什么？
弗斯？
弗斯 什么？
她是个科学家
斯库鲁人说她掌握了光速技术
我得赶在他们之前找到她
不然他们将会入侵更多的星系
不行 你已经被抓到过一次了
离C-53行星还有多远？
到最近的跳跃点需要22个小时
弗斯 原地待命 等我们过去
保持通讯器在线 我们随时会联系你
不行 万一斯库鲁人赶在...
很抱歉
你所拨打的电话
需要输入长途电话公司接入代码
勇·罗格？ 弗斯？
弗斯？
请输入代码后从新拨打
弗斯？
如果斯库鲁人控制了她 那她可能已经叛变了
她没你想的那么脆弱
你去过C-53行星吗？
去过一次
鸟不拉屎的鬼地方
嘿 新来的 去问问那个保安
是你报的警吗？
信号已激活
你好 小姐
你有没有看到一位女士从天而降
把那边的百视达音像店砸了个大洞
有目击者说她穿得像个游戏人物
是的 她好像往那边走了
等等 还得麻烦你再回答我几个问题
或许可以教教你怎么正确的着陆
请出示一下身份证
弗斯 克里星际战队的
我们不兴把身份印在小纸片上
弗斯？
星际...战队是吧？！
你打算在这里待多久？
一找到潜入你们星球的斯库鲁人
我马上就走
斯库鲁人？
易形者
他们可以复制任何生物的基因 改变形态
噢 天啊 你们完全听不懂 是吗
喔 喔 喔 等等
我们怎么知道...你不是易形者中的一员
恭喜你 弗瑞特工
你总算问了个有用的问题
不 我得恭喜你 星际战队女士
你被逮捕了
新来的！
新来的 给我追！
你看到她的武器了吗？
没看到
看着点！
嫌疑人在北行列车上 我正在追
相信我 忠实的信徒 相信我
相信我 忠实的信徒
快下车！
列车马上就要进隧道了
我们去下一站等他们
弗瑞先生 我是科尔森特工
我还在百视达音像店这边
那个...大家都去哪儿了
我刚采集完证据...
快叫救护车
谁报一下警
嘿 你还好吗？
噢 我的天啊 大家还好吧？
你们也看见了吗？
这是神盾局官方行动 请离开
潜水服挺漂亮
开心点儿 亲爱的
给哥笑一个怎样？
神经病
地球上的生命都是碳基的 但他不是
组成它的物质
元素周期表上都没有
你是说他不是地球生物？
你的眼睛怎么样了？
眼睛倒没什么大碍...
就是不敢相信眼前所见的东西
你是说...这东西变成了...科尔森？
嗯 说话也很像他
那个女的说他还有同伙？
她说的是"潜入"
你相信她吗？
直到见到这个才信
你有什么打算？
我能找到那个音像店姑娘
有人报案摩托车被盗
嫌疑人符合她的特征
她知道这些丑八怪打哪来的
没准也能帮上忙把他们赶回去
很好
单独行动 谁也不能相信
连我们的人也要保密
是 长官
哇 这些杂碎长得可真丑 是吗
那是 比不了布拉德·皮特 长官
请安息吧 我的朋友
我会完成我们的大业
最好别靠太近 老大
任何人不得进出
嘣...
想喝点什么？
这张照片是在哪儿拍的？
一个机场
天马计划在哪？
这个可是机密
有关你的档案我也要标成机密
不过我看出来你有点变样了
摇滚范挺适合你
今天很辛苦吧 弗瑞特工？
还行吧 你看
碰上了外星人入侵 玩了把飙车追逐
还有幸观摩了外星人的尸检
典型朝九晚五的一天
这么说你见过斯库鲁人了？
以前我从不相信外星人存在
可是尸体就摆在那儿
设施说起来比较尴尬 但我必须得问
你觉得我也是绿皮蜥蜴变的
小心驶得万年船
你现在看到的是一个100％流着红色血液的地球人
我恐怕需要验证一下
需要我做细胞检测还是尿检？
都不用 他们能复制基因
要我的拨号上网密码吗？
斯库鲁人只能拥有其所模仿宿主的近期记忆
你想问我的私人信息
你在哪儿出生？ 阿拉巴马州 亨茨维尔
不过理论上 我不记得那时候的事了
你的第一只宠物叫什么名字 喷嚏先生
喷嚏先生？ 你没听错
过关了吗
早着呢 第一份工作？
当兵 高中毕业就参军
退役时是上校军衔
之后呢？ 当间谍
在哪儿？ 冷战时期 我们哪里都去
呃 贝尔法斯特 布加勒斯特 贝尔格莱德 布达佩斯
我喜欢B开头的 比较押韵
现在呢？ 干了六年文职
研究地球未来的敌人会来自哪里
可我真没想到敌人会来自太空
说一个斯库鲁人绝对编不出来的怪毛病
面包片要不是正方形 我坚决不吃
没必要问这个吧
对 没必要 但我想问
好吧 该你了
证明你不是斯库鲁人
你来这么一下 就能证明你不是斯库鲁人了吗？
那是光子能量炮
所以呢？
斯库鲁人不会这一招
这么说 你是从军队上校
转做间谍 转做神盾局特工
那你的安全权限肯定挺高
天马计划在哪？
所以 斯库鲁人可以变形成外星种族
以潜入并占领他们的星球
而你是克里人 高贵的战斗种族
是英雄 高贵的战斗英雄
那么 斯库鲁人找劳森博士有什么目的？
他们认为她在天马计划中研发出了光速引擎
光速引擎？
得承认 这还不算是我今天听到的最疯狂的事
是吗 还多着呢
那你呢 你想干什么？
我要在斯库鲁人得手之前阻止他们
还有呢？
听着 全宇宙的战争都一样
我能看出来你是个独行士兵
你来地球有自己的目的
此乃政府领地
请马上离开
尼古拉斯·约瑟夫·弗瑞 神盾局特工
请验证指纹
稍等
尼古拉斯·约瑟夫·弗瑞？ 你有三个名字
大家都叫我弗瑞
不叫尼古拉斯 约瑟夫 或者尼克 就叫弗瑞
你妈妈叫你什么？ 弗瑞
那你叫她什么？ 弗瑞
那你的孩子呢？
如果有的话 也得叫我弗瑞
验证通过 请进
谢谢
对了 稍等一下
你穿的像个叛逆少女
戴上这个
这是什么？ 神盾局标志
把神盾局的标志印在帽子上
适合去执行机密任务吗？
你之前还穿外星橡胶连体服呢！
把法兰裙拿掉
你们有什么事？
我们是神盾局特工
我们想找一位叫劳森的女士
一名博士 温迪·劳森博士
你认识她吗？
跟我来
你有没有听说过 “有朋自远方来”
没有
这里没把我们当朋友
那是通讯器吗？
最先进的双向寻呼机
你在寻呼谁？
我妈妈 别担心 我没有提你
你先请
手艺不错
我用回形针能玩的花样更多
嘿 小家伙 你好啊
哦 天啊 看看你 你个小可爱
你是最可爱的喵星人 是不是
小可爱 叫什么名字？
叫什么名字？
咕咕 拽猫就得配个拽名儿
弗瑞？
回来找你
哦 等我把指纹拿出来
先把这层纸揭下来
你就坐在那里 看着我摆弄胶带
你明明可以...
不想抢了你风头
劳森
劳森画的光速引擎设计图
不知道为什么项目终止了
也许因为她精神错乱？
克里文字
什么？
劳森绝对不是疯子
她是克里人
反正她已经死了
什么
她未经允许
擅自测试飞机
结果连同飞行员一起坠机丧生
所以这里的安保人员才对我们这么凶
这次事故少说也损失了几十亿美元
还有 你找的光速引擎也报废了
飞机是什么时候坠毁的？
六年前 1989年
那个飞行员是谁？
很多资料都有被人修改过的痕迹
不过这儿有一份口供 证人叫玛利亚·兰博
她是最后一个见到劳森的人
你没事吧？
我出去一下
这不是用来打仗的
而是用来终结战争的
我知道劳森是克里人
她就在C-53星球上 而且死于坠机
你知道有这回事吗？
我刚刚发现了一份从C-53发来的任务报告
我能够像你透漏的信息很少 弗斯 但是
劳森是克里帝国的卧底密探 真名叫玛·威尔
她一直在研究某种能量核心的技术
测试一种据说可以
助我们赢下战争的科技
她还在这儿吗？
还在 她很配合调查 长官
你们留在这里待命 是的 长官
我要单独审问她
干得漂亮 尼古拉斯
那份报告上有没有提到我？
提到你？不 当然没有
怎么会提到你？
我找到证据 表明我曾在这里生活过
在C-53行星上？
至高智慧化身成的形象就是玛·威尔
我认识她 我认识身为劳森的她
我觉得你是被斯库鲁人骗了
不 不是 因为我记得 我来过这里
别说了 想想你的训练
了解你的敌人 你的敌人也可能是你自己
别让情绪影响了你的判断力
她在负六楼
我在负五楼下
从楼梯下去 防止她逃跑
来个两面夹击 像在哈瓦那的时候一样
没错 就像那时候一样
我们快到跳跃点了
保持联系 以便我们能找到你
我们会调查清楚这件事 弗斯
我们一起
行！
弗斯？
弗斯？
弗瑞跟目标人物是一伙的
那他叫我们来干嘛？
我只知道要把他一起抓起来 不论死活
不论死活吗？
琼斯 跟着我 快追
我的话有什么破绽吗？
呐 你看 其实我视力很好 不用戴眼镜
不过有眼睛才搭配这身衣服
你觉得呢？
是你叫她们来的？
我的错
科尔森 看到他们了吗？
他们不在下面
楼上去找找
干什么 把通讯器给我 就不该让你拿着它
你会开这玩意儿嘛？
嗯 试试便知
我问你会开还是不会开
会开
这样还差不多
好像有个偷渡的
挺住 咕咕
咕咕
这样可不行 咕咕
谁是乖猫咪啊？ 咕咕你说
很好 答对了
谁是乖猫咪啊？ 咕咕
你就是
有你认识的人吗？
给你讲个故事
我到哈拉星的时候已经半死不活 还失忆了
那是六年前的事
所以你觉得你是那个跟劳森博士一起坠机的飞行员
我认为 最后见过她们的人应该知道些什么
玛利亚·兰博
路易斯安纳州怎么走？
往东飞 在孟菲斯右转
那个特工
就是把我们放走的那个
科尔森 新来的
看来他还不讨厌我
是啊 不过来日方长
他一定察觉到什么了
相信直觉而违抗命令
能做出做这种决定很难 但是
这才是人性
我也经常这么做 总惹麻烦
看得出来
主动就一个把你出卖给斯库鲁人的家伙
这不符合你们战斗英雄的行动准则吧
你要你不告状 我也不揭发你
罗南
指控者舰队圆满完成了任务
但因为你们小队 更重要的任务失败了
这是个圈套
就是为了把弗斯引到托法星 然后绑架她
告诉我们地点 我们会解决斯库鲁人的威胁
把他们炸出银河系吗？
不行 这件事我们自己来解决
斯库鲁人无论在哪
都是对整个克里文明的威胁
他们在哪？
他们在... 失踪了
他们只是暂时隐匿起来了
但我们会找到他们的
最好如此 否则我们接手
继续朝C-53航行
打扰了 请问玛利亚·兰博在吗？
卡罗尔阿姨？
妈妈 是卡罗尔阿姨
我就知道 别人都说你死了
可我们不信
我应该不是你想的那个人
我从没听过这么荒唐的事
绿色的易形外星人 无稽之谈
你说的没错 小姑娘
的确不可能有外星人
就算有
我们也不应该随便说出来
你们不相信我？
不会吧！
这招太酷了！
他这双手能做的可不只是烧开水
还有什么？让我看看
以后再说吧
你的东西我都还留着呢
我去拿给你
你不去帮帮她吗？
你真的什么都不记得了？
只能想起一些闪回的片段
断断续续
不知道是真是假
要是我能知道那天早上到底发生了什么
也许所有的一切就说的通了
你早上来找我 使劲拍门把我叫醒
你经常这么做
那是我们每天都要很早起床
当时的空军也不允许女性驾驶战斗机
所以试驾劳森的飞机是我们最重要的任务
你想开你的老野马比赛飙车去基地
我同意了 因为我开科迈罗稳赢
可是你作弊了 抄近道
抄近道怎么能算作弊？
因为抄近道违反了比赛规则
我可不记得有这种规则
哼 你当然不记得了
我到机库时 劳森很焦躁
她说要赶去救一些人
她本来打算自己驾驶艾西斯 但是你说
如果事关人命 那就你来开
没错 是的 英雄的高光时刻
我们两个都一直渴望着这样的时刻
博士是个很特别的人 所以我们都喜欢她
可是你现在说她是个外星人
我知道你肯定很难接受
怎么 你是说劳森博士这事吗
不 不难接受
最难接受的是在如此机密的任务中
失去我的挚友 而他们却装作设么事都没发生
难的是知道肯定在某个地方顽强的活着
时隔六年 你却又出现在这里
双手还被改造成激光炮
还想让我管你叫...
叫什么来着？ 弗斯！
你还是原来的那个弗斯吗？
我不知道
快来瞧瞧
这是咱俩在万圣节照的
我扮成飞行员艾米莉亚·艾尔哈特，你扮成摇滚歌手詹尼斯·乔普林
哦 这是你小时候照的
你和你父母关系不好
所以妈妈说 我们成了你真正的家人
这是我们在圣诞节照的
我收到了最喜欢的兔子拖鞋
这也是你小时候的照片
你从小就想当一名飞行员
这张照片是你刚毕业的时候照的
这是你圣诞节收到的狗狗
这是你们空军小队的合影
这张是你完成一天的训练之后和妈妈的合影
这是你最喜欢的三个男生
哦 等等 差点忘了
你的外套
有一次我把番茄酱撒在上面 自此之后妈妈就不让我穿了
坠机现场只剩下这个了
我们以为你死了
别开门
没事儿 是邻居
他们可以变成任何人
你好啊
有何贵干？
呃... 嘿 汤姆
这是我朋友 卡罗尔
哦 很高兴见到你
嗷...
天气太干燥 握手都起静电了
我刚才看到你家那只铁皮大鸟停在路边
我就在想...
你介不介意我把孩子们带过来 让他们近距离看一看
近距离看一看？  对
看看停在路边的“大鸟”？
你为了让我相信你 还真是绞尽脑汁 是吧
塔罗斯？
不好意思 汤姆 今天确实不方便
明天我去找你 好吗？
呃...  抱歉
你们应该对邻居的态度友好一点
没准哪天需要向人家借点白糖呢！
别急着动手
稍等一会儿 再到处施展你的无敌神拳
再说 打起来你朋友的房子也会遭殃
装修的不错 小姐
哦 我的天啊
活见鬼了？
没人会伤害她的
只要你们别杀我
杀我只会让情况变得更复杂
再过五秒钟那堵墙就会变得更加复杂
因为你的脑浆将会溅到上面
很抱歉 变成你老大的模样
但我现在是以真实的面目出现在你们面前
没有任何伪装
外面那个人是谁？
好吧 大家半斤八两
可是请各位理解一下
我总得做点预防措施吧
我见你不用手就可以把我20个手下撂倒
我想和你谈谈
上次和你谈
我大头朝下被你吊了起来
那时我还不知道你的过往
不知道你是如此的与众不同
我这里有一段天马计划里你的录音资料
是六年前的飞机坠毁事件里留下的
记录在一个被你们叫做黑匣子的东西里
可他们说 黑匣子已经毁掉了
怎么会在你那里？
她还不知道
小姑娘 我有一项特异功能
可以让我进入一些意想不到的地方
敢再叫我一声小姑娘
我的脚就要飞到你身上一些意想不到的地方
我需要猜猜是什么地方吗？
你的菊花
好 我懂了 大家现在都有点暴躁
但是 说实话 我现在真的很需要你们帮我破译坐标
如果你们能耐心地听完录音
我可以保证 你们会感到物超所值
叫你手下进来我才听
成交
哦 天啊 让他离我远点 他是从哪冒出来的
你是说这只猫吗？
你不会是怕这只猫吧？
那可不是猫
是噬元兽 噬元兽？
妈妈
莫妮卡
我为什么就不能听  嘘
什么情况？
正在加载
输入目的地坐标
5229 -47 8.768 0.        收到 我们要去哪 博士
去我的实验室
你的实验室? 什么意思？
哦 不
那是...等等 那是什么？
我的雷达上没有显示
快 卡罗尔 加速
那不是米格战机 劳森 他们是谁？
他们是坏人 立刻加速
是的 长官
他们想干什么？  我 我的研究成果
真不该带你一起来
我要加速了
他们朝后开火了 坐稳
跳伞 跳伞 快跳伞
坚持住 劳森
卡罗尔 快回答 能听到吗？
是的 我听得到 我们着陆了
卡罗尔 你没事吧？ 能听到吗？
没事 我能听到
博士？
你的血
怎么是蓝色的!
是的 我的发型没乱吧
抬我出去 好吗？
我得赶在他们到来之前毁掉它
劳森？
你还记得我们在这工作的目的吗？
是为了什么？
为了终结战争？
对 但是战争的规模超乎你的想象
该死
我的名字不叫劳森
我的真名叫玛·威尔
我来自一个叫哈拉的行星
我很想说这是你的幻觉
可我们刚刚被一艘太空飞船击落
而且你的血还是蓝色的
听着 我大半生都在打一场可耻的战争
你现在赶紧离开这里 别让我死不瞑目
记住这个坐标 明白吗？
我不在了你也要救他们
救谁？怎么救？
现在我要打爆飞机引擎 不能让他们发现
你要干什么？
我们无意伤害你
是吗？
那恐怕是你们的狂轰滥炸让我误会了
那个能量核心
在哪？
救援队就快到了
你再不走就会被他们包围
那我就更没理由再和你废话了
不 等等
你是说那个能量核心
不
长官 她还活着 请求击毙
先别开火
什么都没了
能量核心被毁了
她吸收了能量
把她带走
他欺骗了我
过去我所知的一切都是谎言
现在你明白了吧
什么？我现在明白了什么？
勇·罗格杀了玛·威尔
他杀了她
因为玛·威尔发现
她处在这场非正义战争的过错一方
不
你的族人都是恐怖分子
他们滥杀无辜
我见过托法星上的惨状
指控者舰队才是毁掉托法星的元凶
我的族人只是移居托法星的难民
无家可归 就因为我们抵抗了克里人的暴政
他们就毁了我们的母星
幸存下来的少数斯库鲁人
也将很快被屠戮殆尽
除非你能帮我完成玛·威尔的遗愿
她研发的那个能量核心
能启动光速引擎飞船送我们到安全的地方
一个克里人找不到的地方
劳森一直教导我们天马计划不会成为战争的帮凶
而是终结战争
他希望你能帮助我们找到能量核心
可是能量核心已经被我毁了
不 你毁的只是引擎
能量核心还被玛·威尔藏在某个偏僻的地方
如果你能帮我们破译坐标
我们就能找到它
你会用它消灭我们的
我们只想有个家园
你和我都是因为克里人才失去一切
你还不明白吗？
你并不是克里人
你根本不了解我
你根本就不知道我是谁
连我自己都不知道我是谁
你是卡罗尔·丹弗斯
你就是黑匣子里记录的那个
为了笃行正义而以身犯险的人
你是我最要好的朋友
力排众议地支持我做母亲 做飞行员
你睿智 幽默 有时又让人超级讨厌
你是我认识的最强大的人
在你还没有能量火拳的时候也是最强大的那个
明白吗？
听懂我的话了吗？
过来 快过来 好姑娘
没事了
我知道我不值得你信任
可你是我们唯一的线索
我们发现你身上的能量特征
与玛·威尔的能量核心特征相吻合
现在我知道原因了
我希望你能理解能量核心对我们的重要性
我非常需要你的帮助
破译出玛·威尔实验室的方位坐标
那些数字不是坐标 而是状态向量
就是定位轨道和速率用的
你之所以找不到她的实验室
是因为它根本就不在地球上
坐标指示的是六年前实验室的轨道位置
只要计算出轨道就能找到它现在的位置
都是中学物理的内容
在绕地轨道上！
连这都算不明白
你还好意思当我的首席科学家
勇罗格很快就会来找我
我们得赶在他之前找到能量核心
嗯 要去太空吗？
坐什么去？
把你现在的飞机改装一下就行了
我可以负责改装工作
嗯 不愧是搞科研的
你来当副驾驶吧
不 我不能去
我不能撇下莫妮卡
妈妈 不用担心 我可以去跟外公外婆住
我不可能去的 宝贝 太危险了
测试新的航天技术也很危险
你不也干过
你打算坐一艘刚刚改造完成
不一定好用的飞船离开地球
很可能遭遇实力远远超过我们的敌人
还要去和他们战斗
对吧？
所以我就说 你一定要去  莫妮卡
你明明有机会执行这么酷出天际的飞行任务
而你却打算整天坐在沙发上陪我看肥皂剧？
什么？
我只是觉得
身为母亲的你应该给女儿树立一个好榜样才对
出什么事了
我知道 我知道
进屋我再解释 谢谢
你妈妈很幸运
当初他们找人认养小孩的时候
他们把最坚强的你给了她
淘气少尉
你记起来了
那是我的吗？
别 别
在我回来之前你就穿着吧
但有件事我需要你帮忙
我不能再穿克里人的制服了
显然你是这群人里
唯一有点穿衣品味的人
不行
这身绝对不行
这样吧 既然我们同属空军
这身怎么样？
帅呆了
你怎么才过来？
我很好 谢谢关心
PRY46-B...  不 不用代码了
我们都知道代码已经没用了
好吧 你随便问
我和至高智慧交谈时 看到的是谁的形象？
我猜是你最尊重 最敬佩的人
不过你从不告诉我是谁
你对哈拉星最初的记忆是什么？
是输血
蓝色的血液流淌进我的身体
谁的血？
那是我的血 她身体里流着我的血
你对她做了什么？
你来晚了
他知道真相了？
罗南 斯库鲁人渗透了C-53行星
你马上过来
为克里人而战 指挥官
我会带舰队消灭这些害虫
飞行高度500 继续爬升中
劝你别把这种生物放在腿上
我们和你结盟的关系还不是很牢靠
只要它能一直吓得你心惊胆战
就像这样
我就会
一直好好照顾它 疼爱它 对吧？
我能问你个问题吗？
你是不是想变成什么都可以？
呃 理论上是这样 不过我得先看到要变的东西
你们族人都会易形吗？
从生理上来讲 是的
但是 也得多加练习
而且变得像不像 也看天赋
你能变成猫吗？ 猫是什么？
能变文件柜吗？
我为什么要变成文件柜？
变成捕蝇草呢？
如果你能变 我立马给你50刀
切换引擎
冲压引擎换到核聚变引擎 系好安全带 大伙！
这样正常吗？ 太空也有气流震动吗？
差不多吧
正在锁定坐标
实验室在哪？
就在这儿  一定在这里
你是说 在这一团漆黑的前面还是后面？
解除隐形模式
能量核心就是它吗？
玛·威尔的笔记里叫它宇宙魔方
劳森为什么有小孩用的东西
这里还有别人
塔罗斯！
他来这里不是为了宇宙魔方
别怕
我们不知道怎么办
玛·威尔警告我们不要发出任何信号
否则会被克里人发现
你做得很对
没事 别怕
她没危险 她是朋友
我不会伤害你们的
是她带我找到你们的
真的很抱歉
我之前不知道
卡罗尔
这就是战争
我的双手也在战争中沾满了鲜血
最终我还是来到了这里
是你让我和家人团圆
这只是刚刚开始
我们还有成千上万的族人被迫分离
流落在整个星系
我要是玩同一个街机游戏玩上六年
我也能刷到最高分
和敌人称兄道弟了 是吧？
你原来的战队制服怎么了？
不出我们所料 她被洗脑了
至高智慧会让她恢复正常的
这些人都是非战斗人员
放了他们 我跟你走
能量核心呢？
你一直在欺骗我
是我让你成为了最优秀的自己
我们赋予你的 我们也能收回来
到那边去 趴下
快点儿走 快 快走
你终于来了
看来C-53已经成功唤起了你的记忆
顺便说一句 这件夹克
真是太帅了
有音乐 气氛不错
放我出去
这可不行
你敢伤害他们 我就把你烧成灰烬
凭什么呢？
你的力量是我给的
是那场爆炸给了我力量
不是你
可你的意志力太弱控制不了自己的力量
物种名称 噬元兽
威胁等级 高
一只猫而已 又不是吃人的汉尼拔
物种名称 人类男性
威胁等级 几乎为零
那破玩意儿肯定坏了
把噬元兽装上飞船
其他人扔进太空
你干的很好 王牌飞行员！
多亏了你
那些狡猾的斯库鲁人再也不会威胁我们的领地了
以前我相信了你的鬼话
但是斯库鲁人只是想有个家园
而你却想消灭他们
就因为他们不屈从于你的淫威
我也不会屈从的
是我们找到了你 还好心接纳了你
你害了我
让我远离家园 失去亲朋好友
你这么拼命还真有点可爱
可你要记住
没有了我们
别逞强了 卡罗尔
下去吧
你太弱小了
你开的太快了 放慢点！
浑身是缺陷
绝望无助
你太情绪化了 太软弱
你不能来赛车场
是我们救了你
控制力量  我告诉过你
卡罗尔  他们绝不会
让你飞的   这可不是
小女孩玩的游戏  连接吻都不会
你挺不过一周 丹弗斯
没有我们 你只是个凡人
你说得对
我就是个凡人
在哈拉星 你获得了重生
弗斯
我的名字 叫卡罗尔
她想挣脱束缚
过去战斗的时候 我只用了一半的力量
你有没有想过
我摆脱束缚了会怎样？
你知道自己在发光 对吧
待会儿跟你解释
拿走宇宙魔方
盒子留给我
我拿吗？  对
我才不碰那玩意儿
需要我给你拿一双隔热手套吗？
带斯库鲁人上飞船离开
记得把噬元兽也带走
那你呢 我给你们争取点时间
我现在要把你抱起来
我对你这么好 你可别吃了我
嘿 你们好啊
想要宇宙魔方吗？
我不再喜欢你的幽默了
给我干掉她
可以啊
乖猫咪
你从一开始就知道
所以你我才看不对眼？
不 我就是单纯的不喜欢你
接招吧
嘿 这么着急走？
别逼我这么做
好吧
上 把他们给收拾了
上啊
快上啊
见鬼了 咕咕
别做墙头草啊
带他们一起去机库
都扔进太空
放松
就像在哈瓦那
魔方在你这吗？
被噬元猫给吞了
快走 跟上
快
跟我来
捂住他的眼镜
快上飞船
大家快点儿 快走
好个狸猫换太子
我明明记得放在里面了
米涅瓦 追上去击落他们
收到
你还好吧 朋友
再好不过了
有个跟屁虫追上来了
太棒了 嘣...
刚才那是什么鬼？
准备导弹攻击
不可能
C-53星球的防御系统很落后
不可能拦截我们的导弹
那个不是导弹防御系统 罗南
全力击落她
全体返回跳跃点
武器早晚是我们的
能量核心吗？
那个女人
我真为你骄傲
自打在湖边发现你之后 你可真成长了不少
可是你能控制情绪和我来场真正的较量吗？
或者说还是像过去一样感情用事
我总是对你说
总有一天 你要依靠自己的力量打败我
这一刻终于到来了
这一刻终于到来了 弗斯
收起花哨的超能力
证明给我看 不用超能力你也能打败我
我没什么需要向你证明的
目的地 哈拉星
我不能空着手回去
你不会空着手回去
你要替我捎一条口信
高素质高智慧我会终结一切
终结战争 谎言 所有一切
你做不到的
刚才真是命悬一线 是不是 咕咕？
那些坏蛋是不是还在哪里窝着呢？
操蛋的噬元兽
你没事吧？ 是的
被挠了一下而已
扯淡
难以置信
这么精彩绝伦的空战我竟然错过了
不得不说你来的还真是时候
你的飞行技术可真炫酷
神盾局就需要你这样优秀的飞行员
我会考虑的
只要你别再说我“炫酷”就行
眼镜怎么样？
嗯 很快就好了
我要再确认一下
是你变成索拉尔
还有神盾局特工？ 凯勒
他抓了我的上司 盗用了他的身份
我只是借用了他的身份 我又不是贼
是有点像做贼
你到底是哪边的？
你可以待在这里安心养伤 直到康复
但是你和你的家人得换个形象见人
我可以再回去当你老大
呃 千万别
说实在的 我挺喜欢他那双蓝眼睛的
这可不行 你们的眼睛最漂亮了
千万别把眼睛也给变了
我会帮你们找个家
完成玛·威尔的遗愿
他们可以和我们住一起
是吗 妈妈？
他们在这不安全 宝贝
卡罗尔阿姨说得对
他们需要一个自己的家园
我很快就会回来
或者我飞到半空中去接你？
那你得像卡罗尔阿姨一样会发光才行
或者我可以学着造飞船 你懂吗？
他确实不懂
你留着宇宙魔方
在地球上藏好
你确定这是玛威的意愿？
玛·威尔
我没念错啊
应该是两个音节 玛 威尔
玛·威尔
玛威听着更舒服
就像玛威惊奇乐队
听着不耳熟吗？
接着唱 没准我能想起来
我给它升了级
信号范围应该至少有好几个星系
干嘛 怕我打骚扰电话给你？
仅限紧急时刻使用 明白吗？
要是你以后路过银河系
别忘了给哥打个招呼
番茄酱洗干净了
谢了 淘气少尉
我也不想说再见
去吧
欢迎回来 长官 这是给你的
这么说 是真的吗？
就因为你不给他们宇宙魔方
克里人就弄瞎了你一只眼睛
对于这类传言 我既不会承认也不会否认
了解
可惜我们的人还没找到宇宙魔方
我相信它早晚会出现的
出现了我立马向你报告
然后呢？
什么？
外太空有哪些威胁我们完全没有头绪
而我们唯一的女英雄
正在宇宙另一头忙着处理自己的事情
只靠神盾局还不行
我们必须找到更多的帮手
更多的武器？
更多的英雄
哪里还有像他这样的人？
有啊 她就是自己送上门的
请多休息 长官
你还要做重大决定呢
可怕的噩梦
噩梦都没这么可怕
那个东西 好像出了什么故障
什么情况？
刚下好像在发信号 现在停下来了
不是已经换过电池了吗？
确实已经换过
现在它还有电 只是关机了
重启系统 再发一次信号
等等 我们还不知道这到底是什么东西
弗瑞知道 就赶紧重启系统吧
一收到信号马上告诉我
我想知道这个信号是发给谁的
弗瑞在哪？
